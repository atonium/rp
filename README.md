### Intro
This is the start of any RP automations we may/may-not deem useful. More to come.

### In-progress
- [ ] Investigation the practicality of a "group cooking cost tracker" for tracking everyone's contributions and organizing them into a "receipt" or "bill of materials".
### Planned
- [ ] Automatically generate a template for radio frequencies and populate frequency values.

### Group Cooking Cost Tracker
For the time being, any templates and work towards this idea will live in the `./public` directory. Expect lots of changes if work continues..
